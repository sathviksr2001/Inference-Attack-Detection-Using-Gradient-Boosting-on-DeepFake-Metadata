# Inference-Attack-Detection-Using-Gradient-Boosting-on-DeepFake-Metadata
To develop and evaluate a Membership Inference Attack (MIA) framework using Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to detect whether a data sample was part of the training dataset of a model, using metadata from a DeepFake dataset (SDFVD).
